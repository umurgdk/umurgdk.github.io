title: Another attempt to start blogging

I really feel productive in these days, learning lots of new things about map systems and presenting them using web technologies like [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) and [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) and trying to build a **game** on top of it. It's hard for me because I have no early experience about map systems but its challenging and enjoyable. I hope there will be more posts about leaflet and other front-end technologies we use at TheCityGame.

There are thousands to share about development, technologie and life, I just want to start from somewhere...
